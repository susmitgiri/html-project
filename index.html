<h1>Pokhara</h1>
<p>Located 200 km west of the capital Kathmandu Pokhara (Nepali: पोखरा) is the second largest city of Nepal as well as the headquarters of Kaski District, Gandaki Zone and the Western Development Region. Despite being a comparatively smaller valley than that of Kathmandu, its geography varies dramatically within just few kilometres from north to south. The altitude varies from 780 m in the southern part to 1350 m in the north. Additionally, the Annapurna Range with three out of the ten highest mountains in the world — Dhaulagiri, Annapurna I and Manaslu — is within about 15 km linear distance from the valley.[1][2][not in citation given] [3] Due to its proximity to the Annapurna mountain range, the city is also a base for trekkers undertaking the Annapurna Circuit through the ACAP region[4] of the Annapurna ranges in the Himalayas.

Pokhara is home to many Gurkha soldiers. It is the most expensive city in the country, with a Cost of Living Index of 95.[5]</p>
